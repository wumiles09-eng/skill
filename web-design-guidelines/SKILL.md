## Common Design Issues to Avoid

1. **Poor Contrast**: Light gray text on white backgrounds
2. **Tiny Touch Targets**: Buttons smaller than 44x44px on mobile
3. **Inconsistent Spacing**: Random margins and padding
4. **Missing Hover States**: No feedback on interactive elements
5. **Generic Templates**: Cookie-cutter bootstrap looks
6. **Orphaned Elements**: Content without clear context
7. **Overflow Issues**: Horizontal scrolling on mobile
8. **Missing Focus States**: No indication of keyboard focus

## Review Process

1. **First Impression**: What's the immediate visual impact?
2. **Content Hierarchy**: Is the most important content prominent?
3. **User Flow**: Can users accomplish their goals easily?
4. **Edge Cases**: How does the design handle long text, errors, empty states?
5. **Accessibility**: Can all users access and use the interface?
6. **Responsiveness**: Does it work across all screen sizes?
